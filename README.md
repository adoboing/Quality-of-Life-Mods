# Instance Timer
First mod ever; Plague helped me make it (aka did basically all of it)

It's in the name, I don't know how else to explain it

Requirements: PlagueButtonAPI | https://github.com/PlagueVRC/PlagueButtonAPI (used for litrally all my mods)

# RIP VRCat
I literally hate that vrc+ cat at the top of the menu

so I made a mod to remove it (meant to be paired with Instance Timer)
